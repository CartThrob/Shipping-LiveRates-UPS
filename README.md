cartthrob-live-rates
================================

**Note**: Compatible with CartThrob 6.2.1

To implement live rates shipping plugins, place them in your system/user/addons folder as you would other add-ons.

Also, please review the included sample template code, as well as the information on the following pages: 

http://cartthrob.com/docs/tags_detail/get_live_rates_form/index.html
http://cartthrob.com/docs/tags_detail/get_shipping_options/

These 2 pages explain how to use live rates plugins, and explain a little bit about using live rates in general. No matter what system you use  any time you use dynamically generated rates gathered directly from a shipping company you will be required to provide large amounts of detail to those shippers in order to get accurate shipping quotes. The included plugins can be used as a starting point for developing your own live rates systems tailored specifically to your customers specifications. Almost every implementation of an accurate live rates system requires customization to your clients specifications. If you are not comfortable working with PHP to modify the software yourself, feel free to contact us: http://cartthrob.com/site/contact_us and we will be happy to offer a personalized quote. 

Please note, modifications and support for these plugins are not included in the standard CartThrob purchase, and will be billed separately. 

This plugin is provided as-is at no cost with no warranty expressed or implied. Support is not included.
